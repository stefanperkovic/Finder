| October 29 | 9am - 10am,  |                               Discussed potential algorithms with my table mates about how to approach the problem set. We floated Tries, TST, Binary, and Hash Tables. We decided that Hash Tables where a key points to an array that stores the potential values from the key. Then we search through this to find and avoid collisions. |
| October 31 | 11am - 12 am | Started to work on implementing the reading in of the lines. Worked on creating an array that will store hash keys and their keys which I decided would be easier to store in a separate class called pair. Implement the same function used in DNA to calculate the hash value for each key some that we can make lookups more efficient.  |
