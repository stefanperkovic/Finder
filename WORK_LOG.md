| October 29 | 9am - 10am,  |                              Discussed potential algorithms with my table mates about how to approach the problem set. We floated Tries, TST, Binary, and Hash Tables. We decided that Hash Tables where a key points to an array that stores the potential values from the key. Then we search through this to find and avoid collisions. |
| October 31 | 11am - 12 am | Started to work on implementing the reading in of the lines. Worked on creating an array that will store hash keys and their keys which I decided would be easier to store in a separate class called pair. Implement the same function used in DNA to calculate the hash value for each key some that we can make lookups more efficient. |
| November 3 | 7:45 - 8:15  |                         I created a Pair class to store key-value entries efficiently. The class includes the key, value, and the computed hash value of the key, which I calculate inside of this new class instead of the main finder class. I am now going to work on implementing the stores of these pairs into a proper hash table.  |
